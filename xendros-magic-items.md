# Xendros' Random Magic Items

<div class='wide'>

Xendros will have random magic items for sale.  At the beginning of each in-game week, items are refreshed. Roll the Item Count die to see how many items Xendros has; then, for each item, roll a d100 + average character level to see which chart to roll on.

| Level | Item Count | [Table B][b] | [Table C][c] | [Table D][d] | [Table E][e] | [Table F][f] | [Table G][g] |
| :---: | :--------: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
|  1-4  | 1d4   | 01-50 | 51-70 | 71-90 | 91+ | &ndash; | &ndash;
|  5-10 | 1d4+1 | 01-36 | 37-63 | 64-81 | 82-90 | 91-99 | 100+
| 11-16 | 1d4+2 | 01-30 | 31-55 | 56-74 | 75-87 | 88-95 | 96+
| 17-20 | 1d4+3 | 01-30 | 31-54 | 55-72 | 73-84 | 85-90| 91+

Use the [Discerning Merchants' Price Guide][dmpg] for prices.

In addition to the random items, every week Xendros will have 1d4 + average character level *potions of healing* available, at 50 gp each.  She will also have a *bag of holding* available (for 500 gp) right from the beginning, and she will get another one when they reach level 5 and another again when they reach level 11.

If the party has any wizard characters, Xendros will always have a spell scroll containing a random spell of the highest level that the wizard has access to.  There might also be other spell scrolls, depending on the random rolls.

Xendros will buy magic items at [half their listed cost][dmpg].
