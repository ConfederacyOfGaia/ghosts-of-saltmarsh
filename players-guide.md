# Ghosts of Saltmarsh Player’s Guide

<div class='wide'>
  
*Nestled on the coast of the Azure Sea is Saltmarsh, a sleepy fishing village that sits on the precipice of destruction. Smugglers guide their ships to hidden coves, willing to slit the throat of any who cross their path. Monsters gather beneath the waves. While Saltmarsh slumbers, the evils that seek to plunder it grow stronger. Heroes must arise to keep the waves safe!*

</div>

## Welcome to Saltmarsh

Our story begins in Saltmarsh, a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. Fishing and trade have brought wealth to Saltmarsh’s roughly five thousand residents. Inns and taverns include the **Wicker Goat**, **Empty Net**, and **Snapping Line**. Other notable locations include the **Dwarven Anvil forge**, the **Temple of Procan**, **Kester's Leather Goods**, the **Mariner’s Guildhall**, the **Arcanists' Conclave**, and the **Weekly Market**.

## A Brief History of Saltmarsh

Years ago the **Kingdom of Keoland** campaigned to the north. Pirates and smugglers slowly took over the south, building a loose confederacy known as the **Hold of the Sea Princes**. Saltmarsh suffered as the village succumbed to piracy and slavery under the cruel Princes.

Suffering a number of defeats in the north, **King Kimbertos Skotti** sent ships south, shattering the confederacy of the Sea Princes.

With the Sea Princes on the run, the King sent troops and agents south to establish security and trade. A band of dwarves, carrying the King’s decree, began to mine in the nearby hills. Although the recent changes promise to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed.

## The Factions of Saltmarsh

The people of Saltmarsh generally find themselves split among two factions. 

***The Traditionalists.*** The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes’ raids and have no desire to see the crown’s ambitions lead to open war.

***The Loyalists.*** The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region.

## The People of Saltmarsh

Saltmarsh consists mainly of humans and halflings. Elves from the Silverstand occasionally pass through on their way to the sea, and Saltmarshans have just started accepting the dwarves from the King's mining company.  More exotic races are entirely unknown.

## Who Are You?
You are a band of adventurers who seek the betterment of the people of Saltmarsh. 

You may be a **fisher**, born to the sea and providing for the town of Saltmarsh. 

You might have come to Saltmarsh with the **dwarven miners**, bold with the King’s decree and eager to make your fortune. 

You might be a **marine**, a soldier of the sea pushing back the smugglers and slavers of the Sea Princes.

You may be a **sailor**, earning your living working one of the countless ships that moor in Saltmarsh.

You may be a **follower of the god Procan**, neutral god of weather and the sea. 

You might be a **scholar**, uncovering the secrets of the universe as a member of the Arcanists' Conclave.

You may be a **shipwright**, building and repairing the vessels that kept the gold coming to Saltmarsh.

You may be an **artisan of the Mariner's Guild**, crafting necessities that keep the ships afloat and ensure they come home safe.

You may be a **smuggler**, bringing in stolen elven wine under the darkness of a moonless night or smuggling innocents out of the clutches of the Sea Princes.

You might be a **veteran** of the Keolish army who fought in the north before being sent to the south to crush the Sea Princes.

Or maybe you're a local kid who just wants to see more of the world and make your mark on it.

Above all you are companions who, together, seek to bring safety and prosperity to the village of Saltmarsh.

# Character Creation

## General Hints

* You're all residents of Saltmarsh.
* The core adventures are oriented toward *investigation* and *interaction*.
* Stealthy skill-monkeys will fare best in the core adventures.
* Clanking tanks and murder hobos will have a particulatly hard time.

## Ability Scores

Use either point buy or standard array.

## Races

The following races are common in Saltmarsh, and can be used as PC races.

##### Human

Humans are the most common race in Saltmarsh.  Because everyone receives a free feat at first level, variant humans are unknown.

##### Halfling

Halflings are the next most common race, split 75%/25% between Lightfoot and Stout varieties.  Most buildings are built to accommodate both human and halfing residents.

##### Elf

The Silverstand is home to a nation of wood elves. They trade with Saltmarsh but rarely make their homes there, though there are exceptions.

An occasional high elf arrives in Saltmarsh via ship, but very few of them stay. If you want to play a high elf, you will need a story of how you arrived in Saltmarsh, and why you've stayed.

##### Half-elf

Though elves are rare, half-elves are merely uncommon. Many residents of Saltmarsh find elven visitors... appealing.  You can choose the standard half-elf, or the wood elf or high elf varities from SCAG.

##### Dwarf

Dwarves are not native to this area, so if you're a dwarf you're part of the contingent of dwarven miners have been sent to Saltmarsh by King Skotti.  Both hill and mountain dwarves are represented equally.

##### Half-orc

Orcs are known to live on the far side of the swamps but generally keep to themselves.  Unlike orcs in other lands, these orcs are civilized and have a complex culture, so Saltmarsh sees the occasional half-breeds.

##### Others

There are only two tieflings in Saltmarsh, and they are native to the Free City of Greyhawk, not Saltmarsh. If you want to play a tiefling, you will have arrived with them.

Any races or subraces not mentioned above are unknown.

## Backgrounds

Pick a background that is thematically consistent with Saltmarsh, its environments, and its industries. You will roll on the *Lifestyle and Starting Resources* table, below, which will indicate how successful you were in your past (or possibly still are).

5E encourages you to create custom backgrounds that provide any two skills and any combination of two languages, tools, musical instruments, or gaming sets.  dndbeyond.com supports this natively.

## Languages

Because of the limited racial diversity, only a few languages are available to be learned.

* Common
* Deep Speech
* Draconic (*Arcanists' Conclave only*)
* Dwarvish
* Elvish
* Giant
* Halfling
* Orcish
* Sylvan (*Folks from the Silverstand only*)


## First Level Feats

First level feats are ok, subject to approval. They should be thematically consistent with your background, and the following feats are unavailble at first level:

* Lucky
* Great Weapon Master
* Heavy Armor Master
* Sentinel
* Sharpshooter

## Motivation to Adventure

When creating your character, ask yourself these questions:

* Why are you an adventurer?
* What are you hoping to achieve?
* Why did you leave your normal mundane life, and what keeps you from going back to it?
* Do you have any regrets?

## Connections

Because the PCs live in Saltmarsh, each will have a job (with an accompanying lifestyle), a connection to one of the major NPCs in town (see *Roster of NPCs*, below), and a connection to 2 other PCs.  We'll figure this out during session 0.

## Lifestyle and Starting Resources

Roll on this table to determine their starting resources.  A note of ***Debt*** or ***Savings*** indicates that you should roll 1d100, and possibly multiply by the indicator.  Daily costs reflect upkeep of housing, costs of food, paying retainers, and other routine expenses.


| 1d10 | Lifestyle   | Daily Cost | Housing | Starting Resources |
|:----:|:---------   |:----------:|:------- |:------------------|
|    1 | Wretched    |   &mdash;  | Homeless | Debt x 3
|    2 | Squalid     |   1 sp     | Crashing with friend | Debt x 2
|  3-4 | Poor        |   2 sp     | House (rented) | Debt x 2, Savings x 1
|  5-7 | Modest      |   1 gp     | House (owned) | Debt x 1, Savings x 3
|  8-9 | Comfortable |   2 gp     | House (owned) |  Business co-owner, Savings x 5
|   10 | Wealthy     |   4 gp     | House (family owned) |  Ship, Business owner, Retainers, Savings x 10

The above is in addition to any starting equipment the character receives from their background or class.

## Roster of NPCs

Saltmarsh is home to many unique individuals.  The following table lists many of them.  Because the PCs come from Saltmarsh, they will have at least a passing familiarity with most, or possibly all, of them.

## About Saltmarsh

The town of Saltmarsh sits on a bay that leads to the Azure Sea, and is surrounded to the north, east, and west by rocky hills and forests.  ~~Only the elves of the Silverstand come to Saltmarsh overland; all other travel happens by ship.~~

* Overland visitors from Burle and Seaton

The roughly five thousand residents are predominantly human and halfling, with the dwarven mining contingent of about two hundred workers the largest non-human faction in town. Elves are rare but draw no special notice, since the Silverstand hosts a wood elf enclave.

Residents primarily make their living as fishers, traders, importers, and merchants.  Importers account for a significant amount of inbound ships, and the docks are the busiest and most important part of the town.  There are a small number of farms immediately surrounding the town, but the land gives way to rocky hills so quickly that locally-grown produce and locally-raised animals are few in number, and fetch steep prices.

* Increase the number of farms, but still rely heavily on seafood and imports


## Religion

**Procan**, god of the sea (N), attracts the lion's share of worship in Saltmarsh. Every sailor and seaman seeks his blessing before heading out, and the only temple in town is dedicated to him.  Idols to **Hextor** (god of war, LE) and **Obad-hai** (god of nature, N) are scattered throughout the town, every gambler calls upon **Rudd** (goddess of luck, CN), and all invoke **Fharlanghn** (god of travel, N) before every journey.  The Arcanists' Conclave brought worship of **Boccob** (god of magic, N), though he is unknown otherwise.
