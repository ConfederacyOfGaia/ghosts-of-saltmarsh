# Ghosts of Saltmarsh Player’s Guide

<div class='wide'>
  
*Nestled on the coast of the Azure Sea is Saltmarsh, a sleepy fishing village that sits on the precipice of destruction. Smugglers guide their ships to hidden coves, willing to slit the throat of any who cross their path. Monsters gather beneath the waves. While Saltmarsh slumbers, the evils that seek to plunder it grow stronger. Heroes must arise to keep the waves safe!*

</div>

## Welcome to Saltmarsh

Our story begins in Saltmarsh, a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. Fishing and trade have brought wealth to Saltmarsh’s roughly five thousand residents. Inns and taverns include the **Wicker Goat**, **The Empty Net**, and **The Snapping Line**. Other notable locations include the **Dwarven Anvil forge**, the **Temple of Procan**, **Kester's Leather Goods**, the **Mariner’s Guildhall**, and the **Arcanists Conclave**.

## A Brief History of Saltmarsh

Years ago the **Kingdom of Keoland** campaigned to the north. Pirates and smugglers slowly took over the south, building a loose confederacy known as the **Hold of the Sea Princes**. Saltmarsh suffered as the village succumbed to piracy and slavery under the cruel Princes.

Suffering a number of defeats in the north, **King Kimbertos Skotti** sent ships south, shattering the confederacy of the Sea Princes.

With the Sea Princes on the run, the King sent troops and agents south to establish security and trade. A band of dwarves, carrying the King’s decree, began to mine in the nearby hills. Although the recent changes promise to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed.

## The Factions of Saltmarsh

The people of Saltmarsh generally find themselves split among two factions. 

***The Traditionalists.*** The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes’ raids and have no desire to see the crown’s ambitions lead to open war.

***The Loyalists.*** The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region.

## The People of Saltmarsh

Saltmarsh consists mainly of humans and halflings. Elves from the Silverstand occasionally pass through on their way to the sea, and Saltmarshans have just started accepting the dwarves from the King's mining company.  More exotic races are entirely unknown.

## Who Are You?
You are a band of adventurers who seek the betterment of the people of Saltmarsh. 

You may be a **fisher**, born to the sea and providing for the town of Saltmarsh. 

You might have come to Saltmarsh with the **dwarven miners**, bold with the King’s decree and eager to make your fortune. 

You might be a **marine**, a soldier of the sea pushing back the smugglers and slavers of the Sea Princes.

You may be a **sailor**, earning your living working one of the countless ships that moor in Saltmarsh.

You may be a **follower of the god Procan**, neutral god of weather and the sea. 

You might be a **scholar**, uncovering the secrets of the universe as a member of the Arcanists' Conclave.

You may be a **shipwright**, building and repairing the vessels that kept the gold coming to Saltmarsh.

You may be an **artisan of the Mariner's Guild**, crafting necessities that keep the ships afloat and ensure they come home safe.

You may be a **smuggler**, bringing in stolen elven wine under the darkness of a moonless night or smuggling innocents out of the clutches of the Sea Princes.

You might be a **veteran** of the Keolish army who fought in the north before being sent to the south to crush the Sea Princes.

Or maybe you're a local kid who just wants to see more of the world and make your mark on it.

Above all you are companions who, together, seek to bring safety and prosperity to the village of Saltmarsh.

# Character Creation

## General Guidelines

* You're all residents of Saltmarsh.
* The core adventures are oriented toward *investigation* and *interaction*.
* Stealthy skill-monkeys will fare best in the core adventures.
* Clanking tanks and murder hobos will have a particulatly hard time.

## Ability Scores

Use either point buy or standard array.

## Races

The following races are common in Saltmarsh, and can be used as PC races.

##### Human

Humans are the most common race in Saltmarsh.  Variant humans are ok, even though everyone receives a free feat at first level.

##### Halfling

Halflings are the next most common race, split 75%/25% between Lightfoot and Stout varieties.  Most buildings are built to accommodate both human and halfing residents.

##### Elf

The Silverstand is home to a nation of wood elves. They trade with Saltmarsh but rarely make their homes there, though there are exceptions.

An occasional high elf or eladrin arrives in Saltmarsh via ship, but very few of them stay. If you want to play a high elf, you will need a story of how you arrived in Saltmarsh, and why you've stayed.

##### Half-elf

Though elves are rare, half-elves are merely uncommon. Many residents of Saltmarsh find elven visitors... appealing.  You can choose the standard half-elf, or the wood elf or high elf varities from SCAG.

##### Dwarf

Dwarves are not native to this area, so if you're a dwarf you're part of the contingent of dwarven miners have been sent to Saltmarsh by King Skotti.  Both hill and mountain dwarves are represented equally.

##### Half-orc

Orcs are known to live on the far side of the swamps but generally keep to themselves.  Unlike orcs in other lands, these orcs are civilized and have a complex culture, so Saltmarsh sees the occasional half-orc.

##### Others

There are only two tieflings in Saltmarsh, and they are native to the Free City of Greyhawk, not Saltmarsh. If you want to play a tiefling, you will have arrived with them.

Any races or subraces not mentioned above are unknown.

## Backgrounds

Pick a background that is thematically consistent with Saltmarsh, its environments, and its industries. You will roll on the *Lifestyle and Starting Resources* table, below, which will indicate how successful you were in your past (or possibly still are).

5E encourages you to create custom backgrounds that provide any two skills and any combination of two languages, tools, musical instruments, or gaming sets.  dndbeyond.com supports this natively.

## Languages

Because of the limited racial diversity, only a few languages are available to be learned.

* Common
* Deep Speech
* Draconic (*Arcanists Conclave only*)
* Dwarvish
* Elvish
* Giant
* Halfling
* Orcish
* Sylvan (*Folks from the Silverstand only*)


## First Level Feats

First level feats are ok, subject to approval. They should be thematically consistent with your background, and the following feats are unavailble at first level:

* Lucky
* Great Weapon Master
* Heavy Armor Master
* Sentinel
* Sharpshooter

## Motivation to Adventure

When creating your character, ask yourself these questions:

* Why are you an adventurer?
* What are you hoping to achieve?
* Why did you leave your normal mundane life, and what keeps you from going back to it?
* Do you have any regrets?

## Connections

Because the PCs live in Saltmarsh, each will have a job (with an accompanying lifestyle), a connection to one of the major NPCs in town (see *Roster of NPCs*, below), and a connection to one of the other PCs.  We'll figure this out during session 0.

# A Longer History of Saltmarsh

Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom’s borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown’s wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom’s attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.

The crown’s benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes. With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes’ raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals’ hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.

In time, Keoland’s victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes — but the conflict is by no means over.

King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated. If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade.

Saltmarsh, remote though it might be from the center of power in Keoland, is entering a new phase of its life as it reacts to the king’s plans. The crown’s agents want to expand the village’s port and make it a prime location for trade with the world beyond. In another recent development, a band of dwarves — bearing a decree from the king himself — have arrived and begun to excavate the hills and seaside cliffs near town, looking for precious metals. If their work bears fruit as expected, the mine stands to become a major factor in the village’s — and, indeed, the entire region’s — prosperity.

Naturally, not all of Saltmarsh’s residents feel the same way about the recent developments in and around their community, which is the key issue that affects their lives and livelihood. Although the recent changes stand to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don’t want to see their home changed.

Saltmarsh’s future rests in the hands of two factions that compete for supremacy. These two factions represent the opposing sentiments that have grown in town in recent years. Their struggles play out in the day-to-day lives of the townsfolk and the political maneuvering of Saltmarsh’s town council.

The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes’ raids and have no desire to see the crown’s ambitions lead to open war. The smugglers who operate in the area tend to be traditionalists. Most pose as merchants and rely on their local contacts to move goods through the region without interference from the town guard or royal agents. Smuggling has long been an easy way to make money in Saltmarsh, and locals generally look the other way, seeing it as a victimless crime.

The traditionalists would like to see the dwarves’ mining efforts fail and interest from the north wane, so that Saltmarsh’s dependable fishing trade can thrive and the smugglers in the area are left alone. They resent the intrusion of outsiders seeking to transform Saltmarsh and undoubtedly drain power from the fishing families to give to dwarves and merchants.

Traditionalists are community-minded folk who want Saltmarsh to return to its old way of doing things, arguing that the town has survived for a century by sticking to its original priorities. They suffered mightily due to the Sea Princes’ depredations and remember the days when the crown turned a blind eye to their troubles. Their loyalty to the king runs second to their desire for peace and quiet.

The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region. The town guard, the dwarves, and the local farmers are generally loyalists.

The loyalists care about security. They want to keep Keoland’s enemies at bay while ensuring law and order. They see smuggling as a key problem, as it enriches the Sea Princes at the cost of the royal treasury and the efforts of honest merchants.

Above all else, the members of this faction put their faith in law. They exert influence through the town guard, though they remain within their legal authority. They want to grow Saltmarsh into a trading hub with a higher standard of living and improved security. If the Sea Princes are held in check and the sea lanes cleared of threats, Saltmarsh can grow to become the envy of the world.
