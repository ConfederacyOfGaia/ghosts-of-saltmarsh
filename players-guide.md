# Ghosts of Saltmarsh Player’s Guide

*Nestled on the coast of the Azure Sea is Saltmarsh, a sleepy fishing village that sits on the precipice of destruction. Smugglers guide their ships to hidden coves, willing to slit the throat of any who cross their path. Monsters gather beneath the waves. While Saltmarsh slumbers, the evils that seek to plunder it grow stronger. Heroes must arise to keep the waves safe!*

## Welcome to Saltmarsh

Our story begins in Saltmarsh, a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. Fishing and trade have brought wealth to Saltmarsh’s roughly five thousand residents. Inns and taverns include the **Wicker Goat**, **Empty Net**, and **Snapping Line**. Other notable locations include the **Dwarven Anvil forge**, the **Temple of Procan**, **Kester's Leather Goods**, the **Mariner’s Guildhall**, the **Arcanists' Conclave**, and the **Weekly Market**.

## A Brief History of Saltmarsh

Years ago the **Kingdom of Keoland** campaigned to the north. Pirates and smugglers slowly took over the south, building a loose confederacy known as the **Hold of the Sea Princes**. Saltmarsh suffered as the village succumbed to piracy and slavery under the cruel Princes.

Suffering a number of defeats in the north, **King Kimbertos Skotti** sent ships south, shattering the confederacy of the Sea Princes.

With the Sea Princes on the run, the King sent troops and agents south to establish security and trade. A band of dwarves, carrying the King’s decree, began to mine in the nearby hills. Although the recent changes promise to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed.

## The Factions of Saltmarsh

The people of Saltmarsh generally find themselves split among two factions. 

***The Traditionalists.*** The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes’ raids and have no desire to see the crown’s ambitions lead to open war.

***The Loyalists.*** The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region.

## The People of Saltmarsh

Saltmarsh consists mainly of humans and halflings. Elves from the Silverstand occasionally pass through on their way to the sea, and Saltmarshans have just started accepting the dwarves from the King's mining company.  More exotic races are entirely unknown.
