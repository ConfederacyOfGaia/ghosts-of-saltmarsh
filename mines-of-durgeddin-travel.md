# Finding the mine of Durgeddin

The plan is for the characters to spend a day or so searching the area east of Seaton to find the Stone Tooth, under which lies Khundrukar, the mine of Durgeddin.  The area is covered with broken hills and violent spikes of stone, while still being lush with evergreen trees and undergrowth.

The party arrives during a heavy rainstorm, so visibility is reduced and everything is soaked.  The hillls are completely impassable by a cart or beast of burden, as there is a lot of climbing involved.


## Travel rules

*Roughly adapted from [Tomb of Annihilation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/the-land-of-chult#TheExpeditionBegins).*

* Using the battle mat, identify the hex in which the party is currently located. Don't share this information with the players if the party is lost; otherwise, show the players the party's location by pointing to the appropriate hex on the battle mat.  
* Let the players determine what direction the party wants to go. (See "Travel Distances", below)
* Let the players choose a navigator, then make a Wisdom (Survival) check on the navigator’s behalf to determine if the party becomes lost (see "Navigation" below).
* Check for random encounters each time the party enters a hex.  Roll a d4; on an odd result, nothing occurs, and on an even result the party has an encounter.  (See "Random Encounters", below)

### Travel Distances

On the battle mat, each hex is the same size as one of the smaller hexes on the Saltmarsh Region map, and represents **7500 yards**, or **~4.25 miles**.  Because of the difficult nature of the terrain, traversing one hex at normal speed speed takes **2 hours**, rather than 1.5h.

### Navigation

Have the players designate one party member as the navigator.  Whenever the party enters a new hex, the DM makes a Wisdom (Survival) check on behalf of the navigator. The result of the check determines whether or not the party becomes lost over the course of traversing the hex. The DC of the check is based on that hex's most common terrain: DC 10 for gently-rolling land, or DC 15 if there is a dramatic geographical feature.

If the check succeeds, the navigator knows exactly where the party is on the battle mat.

If the check fails, the party becomes lost. Each hex on the map is surrounded by six other hexes; whenever a lost party moves 1 hex, roll a d6 to randomly determine which neighboring hex the party enters, and do not divulge the party's location to the players. While the party is lost, players can't pinpoint the group's location on their map. The next time a navigator succeeds on a Wisdom (Survival) check made to navigate, reveal the party's actual location to the players.

### Random Encounters

Each time a party enters a new hex, roll a 1d4.  On an odd result, nothing happens as the party traverses the hex.  On an even result, they have an encounter.  Work through the list of encounters below, in order, each time an encounter is specified.  When the list of encounters is exhausted, the party arrives at the Stone Tooth.

Except for the last encounter, the party will not have an encounter in two consecutive hexes; once the party has an encounter, the roll in the next hex is automatically a 1.

#### Encounter List

1. The characters unwittingly enter the hunting grounds of 3 **[assassin vines](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/assassin-vine)**. The vines are indistinguishable from normal plants and can't be spotted with Wisdom (Perception) checks. However, they draw carrion to their roots, so characters might smell a dead body nearby. Reduce poison damage to 3d6.
1. [Needle's Bones](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/toa/the-land-of-chult#NeedlesBones), see below.
1. The party stumbles on a hidden camp.  Three open-faced wooden lean-tos surround a fire pit.  One of the lean-tos has a cache of equipment: 2 explorers packs (minus rations), 2 daggers, 2 50 ft. coils of rope, and two vials of antitoxin.
1. A patrol of 4 **[orcs][orc]**, prowling for intruders. They are immediately hostile.
1. The party finds the bodies of another adventuring party, freshly killed: A elf in wizard robes, carrying a spellbook (contains the spells that an **[evil mage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/evil-mage)** would have prepared); a human fighter clad in splintmail and wielding a glaive; and a halfling clad in leather bearing a shortbow and a dagger. All three have explorers packs, with rations intact, and all three bodies bear signs of being hit repeatedly by an axe.  The bodies have been stripped of treasure, although a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the elf is wearing a *[ring of the ram](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/ring-of-the-ram)* which the orcs missed.  The party will encounter the patrol of orcs immediately in the next hex.
1. A patrol of 4 **[orcs][orc]**, injured from a recent fight and carrying loot from the adventurers they just killed: 200 gp and a bejeweled necklace worth 50 gp.  The Stone Tooth is in the next hex.

### Finding the Stone Tooth

The location of the Stone Tooth is not predetermined; it is determined by the party having made it through all of the encounters.

## Terrain Types

There are several types of terrain that the party will traverse. The majority of hexes are *Forest* hexes.

### Forest

A patch of thick evergreen forest, soaked from rain and sloping upwards or downwards.  Unless marked otherwise, assume a hex is a *Forest* hex.

### Forest with River

A river running through an otherwise typical *Forest* hex.  A river will be anywhere form 30 to 80 feet wide, and it will always run downhill.

### Rocky Promontory

A bare, rocky hill poking out of the surrounding forest toward the sky.  It's possible to look around to get the lay of the land from the peak of one of these hills.  These will occasionally have a spring that creates a river, leading to a *Forest with River* hex.

If the party's score is 22 or higher and they look around from the top of a hill, they will see a column of smoke rising from the ***(B) Chimney*** location of the Stone Tooth.


### River-adjacent

A rocky ledge running alongside a river, surrounded on each side by *Forest* hexes but itself fairly clear.

### Pond

This hex consists mostly of a swampy pond. One or more rivers will terminate in it.

### Waterfall

There are a few waterfalls in the hills. They are majestic and are alwasy next to a *Rocky Promontory* hex.

```
```

## Camping

It will take the party a few days to find the Stone Tooth, which means they'll need to make camp at least once.  Use the following encounters; it's okay to not use them all.

### First Night

The first night, in the early morning (third watch), a patrol of 4 **[orcs][orc]** will stumble onto their camp.  The character on watch will hear the orcs thrashing through the forest on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check; they are not being quiet, as they assume noone will actually be in the woods.

If the party has a fire going, the orcs will see it 1 round after the character hears them; no one will have surprise.  If the party has no campfire, the orcs will stumble onto the camp and will be surprised.

### Second Night

The second night will pass uneventfully.

### Third Night

On the third night, a group of 3 **[manticores](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/manticore)** spots the party early in the evening, and attacks.  Once 2 are killed, the 3rd will attempt to flee. The rest of the night will be uneventful.

### Fourth Night and beyond

There are no more night time encounters.

# Needle's Bones

>A wide sinkhole yawns before you, the earth around it littered with small humanoid bones. The opening is 90 feet across and roughly circular, and the stone walls are nearly vertical. Thirty feet down, the sinkhole is filled with murky green water. Hundreds of frogs hop from one floating plant to another.
>
> The massive rib cage and fine wing bones of a dragon rise above the murk. Vines, moss, and lichen hang from the bones. Judging from how much of the skeleton is exposed, the water can’t be more than 3 or 4 feet deep.

The walls of the sinkhole are rough and draped with dozens of stout vines, so climbing into or out of the grotto is easy and automatically successful.

The bones are the remains of Ormalagos, an adult green dragon better known during her lifetime as Needle. She used this grotto as a lair but feared goblins had sniffed out its location and were getting ready to raid it. Needle was in the process of moving her treasure to other locations when the goblins struck. While the dragon was away, they dumped baskets full of quippers into the sinkhole. When the dragon returned, they trapped her in the sinkhole with vine nets. As the quippers devoured the dragon from below, the goblins showered Needle with spears from above until she finally died. Nearly the entire goblin tribe perished in the fight, too.

The characters' first impression of the water is correct; it varies from 3 to 4 feet deep everywhere. A search of the muddy bottom turns up hundreds of goblin bones and stone spear heads, greatly annoys the multitude of frogs, and draws attacks from two [swarms of quippers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/swarm-of-quippers). Someone who examines the dragon bones and succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check sees enough regularity in the vines draped across the ribs to conclude the dragon was tangled in a net. To identify the remains as a green dragon, characters must lift its skull out of the water and muck; that feat takes a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

```
```

### Treasure

A 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high secret door in the northwest wall of the grotto conceals a 15-foot-deep alcove. The secret door is carved from natural rock and disguised to look like part of the wall, and all the plants around it are dead. The secret door can be detected with a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check. Characters who inspect the plants around the door and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check can tell that the plants were killed by poison. Needle opened the secret door by breathing poison gas on it; smearing or spraying poison on the door also causes it to swing open. Otherwise, a *knock* spell or similar magic is needed to open it.

Needle hid the following items in the alcove: a purse made from reptilian hide, a small box made from two mammalian skulls cleverly fitted together, and a hollow femur with a wax plug at one end. The purse contains 55 gp, 800 sp, and three blue quartz rings (10 gp each). The skull box is worth 12 gp and contains a *[wand of magic missiles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/wand-of-magic-missiles)* and two diamonds (500 gp each). The hollow femur contains five *+1 sling bullets*.

# Khundrukar: The mine of Durgeddin

Durgeddin was a master smith who forged blades of surpassing quality and power. Centuries ago, his home was sacked by orcs. Durgeddin led the remnants of his clan to the mountains north of the town of Blasingdell and established a small, secret stronghold somewhere in the trackless wilderness.

From his hidden redoubt, he waged a decades-long vendetta against all orc-kind, until his enemies discovered his fortress and attacked it after a long siege. Durgeddin and his followers perished, and much wealth was carried away by the conquering hordes. But it’s said that the deepest and best-hidden vaults and armories escaped the looting, and that some of Durgeddin’s extraordinary blades still wait in the darkness for a hand bold enough to claim one.
