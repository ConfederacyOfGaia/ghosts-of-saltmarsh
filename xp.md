# Experimental Saltmarsh XP Protocol

Tracking XP in the traditional sense is error prone and fiddly, and really only rewards killing monsters.  Milestone XP is an improvement, but it assumes that you are running a linear campaign with well-defined story beats, and is not friendly to new characters or players that cannot attend every session.  The below alternate XP system attempts to address these issues by presenting a simpified point-based system that rewards players for good play, big-picture thinking, and adhering to their characters' beliefs.

## Assumptions

The assumptions of this system are:

* The characters are invested in the town of Saltmarsh and are actively working towards its embetterment, and
* The players have defined their characters' *Motivation to Adventure* during character creation.

### Motivation to Adventure

The Motivation to Adventure is a short, concrete statement of purpose that directs a character's actions.  For example, "Eliminate piracy and civilize Saltmarsh", or "Seek revenge on the clan of orcs that destroyed the town of Burle."  A character's Motivation to Adventure can change over time as goals are reached and priorities evolve, and is evaluated separately at the end of each session.  Characters whose behavior is not consistent with their Motivation to Adventure are not penalized beyond losing out on potential XP, though too much variance should lead to reevaluation.

## Earning XP

There are three categories of XP: *individual*, *group*, and *session*.  At the end of every session, the DM and players will collectively decide what earn character earns.


### Individual

Each character can potentially earn all of these every session.

* 1 XP for completing the session. Everyone always earns this.
* 1 XP for adhering to your Motivation to Adventure.
* 1 XP for effectively utilizing your NPC connections in Saltmarsh.

### Group

Everyone present at the sesaion earns these points if the group as a whole achieves the goal during the current session.

* 1 XP for improving the safety or economy of Saltmarsh and/or the immediate area.
* 1 XP for completing one of the core adventures from Ghosts of Saltmarsh.

### Session

* A single character is voted Session MVP by the group. They earn 1 XP.
* The DM can choose to issue everyone in the group an additional XP if the session was particularly grueling or well-played.



## Spending XP

Players may spend downtime-based XP at the beginning of a session when downtime is resolved, and at other well-defined points as well.

### Leveling up

You can spend XP to gain a level. For a class in which you already have levels, the cost to gain another level is equal to your new character level.  If you are multiclassing into a new class, this cost is increased by 1.  If you have arranged a strong narrative set up to this new class, the extra point can be waived.  For example, a party who fights in the siege of a city might be eligible to take a level of fighter without spending this additional point because they've learned directly from career soldiers.

You can only level up once per session, and it can be done after any long rest (no downtime required).

### Natural 20

You can spend 1 XP to automatically roll a natural 20 on any d20 roll.  You can do this after die is rolled but before you learn if it succeeds.  The roll need not be your own.

### ASIs and Feats

You can spend XP after a period of downtime to increase your ability scores or learn a feat:

* Spend 5 XP to gain a feat.  You must meet all of the feat's normal prerequisites.
* Spend 3 XP to increase one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Spend 5 XP to increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Spend 8 XP to increase one ability score of your choice by 2, and increase your maximum for that ability score to 22.

There should be a narrative build up to the increase.

### Magic Items

You can arrange for Xendros to procure a magic item for you.  The costs are 8 XP for a Very Rare item, 6 XP for a Rare item, and 4 XP for an Uncommon item.  If the item is a consumable (potion or scroll), the cost is reduced by half. Only non-unique items are available this way.

Such a special order must be arranged with Xendros in person, and takes 1d4 weeks to arrive.
