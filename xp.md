## Earning XP

There are three categories of XP: *individual*, *group*, and *session*.  At the end of every session, the DM and players will collectively decide what earn character earns.


### Individual

Each character can potentially earn all of these every session.

* 1 XP for completing the session.
* 1 XP for adhering to your Motivation to Adventure.
* 1 XP for effectively utilizing your NPC connections in Saltmarsh

### Group

Everyone present at the sesaion earns these points if the group as a whole achieves the goal during the current session.

* 1 XP for improving the safety or economy of Saltmarsh and/or the immediate area.
* 1 XP for completing one of the core adventures from Ghosts of Saltmarsh.

### Session

A single character is voted Session MVP by the group. They earn 1 XP.

## Spending XP

At the start of a session, characters may spend XP. A character can only gain one level per session.  Spending XP to get a benefit requires at least 1 week of downtime unless there is explicit timing indicated.

### Leveling up

You can spend XP to gain a level. For a class in which you already have levels, the cost to gain another level is equal to your new character level.  If you are multiclassing into a new class, the cost increases by 1.  If you have arranged a strong narrative set up to this new class, the extra point can be waived.

You can only level up once per session, and it can be done after any long rest (no downtime required).

### Natural 20

Once per session, you can spend 1 XP to gain a natural 20 on any d20 roll.  You can do this after die is rolled but before the DM tells you if it succeeds.  The roll need not be your own.

### Magic Items

You can arrange for Xendros to special order a magic item for you.  The costs are 8 XP for a Very Rare item, 6 XP for a Rare item, and 4 XP for an Uncommon item.  If the item is a consumable (potion or scroll), the cost is reduced by half. Only non-unique items are available this way.

Such a special order must be arranged with Xendros in person, and takes between one week (Uncommon) and three weeks (Very Rare) to arrive.

### ASIs and Feats

You can spend XP and downtime to increase your ability scores or learn a Feat:

* Spend 5 XP to gain a feat.
* Spend 3 XP to get a +1 to 1 ability score.
* Spend 5 XP to get a +2 to 1 ability score, or a +1 to 2 ability scores.
* Spend 8 XP to get a +2 to 1 ability score and increase that ability score's max value by 2.

There should be a narrative build up to the increase.
